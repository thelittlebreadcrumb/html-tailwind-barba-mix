# HTML + Tailwind + Barba + Laravel Mix Starter

Bundlers. are. daunting. Also, Barba JS has _the_ worst docs for a beginner. 

Hopefully this repo helps _someone_. If it has, please reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bhavyadaiya).

Really though, I'm glad to have done a whole lot of research (that eventually led nowhere) which at least allowed to get a clue about what's going on.
