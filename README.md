# HTML + Tailwind + Barba + Laravel Mix Starter

**Bundlers. are. daunting** ...and Barba JS docs = ðŸ—‘. 

This stuff really shouldn't have to be this complicated â€“ hence Iâ€™ve made this repo public to help my future self and others. If this has helped you, please reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bhavyadaiya) - I'd love to know what you're working on.

I'm glad to have done a whole lot of research (that eventually led nowhere) which at least allowed to get a clue about what's going on.
